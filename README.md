# Tree_incongruence_divergence_times
Simulation experiments for the effects of gene tree species tree incongruence for divergence time estimation.
"non_coalescent_v1.R" simulates incongruence by random swaps of clades.
"coalescent_v1.R" simulates incongruence through multispecies coalescent process.
"rev_shell.Rev" analyses output from simulations.
Run "clean_up_runs_data.py" prior to "results.R"
