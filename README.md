# The implications of incongruence between gene tree and species tree topologies for divergence time estimation
The scripts presented here are relevent to the article: Carruthers et al. The implications of incongruence between gene tree and species tree topologies for divergence time estimation. Syst Biol.  

--- detailed instructions coming shortly ---

## Simple four taxon
To generate simulated data, [run four_taxon_simulation.R] (https://github.com/pebgroup/tree_incongruence_divergence_times/blob/master/simple_four_taxon/simple_four_taxon_simulation.R)


## Simple sixteen taxon
Use for generating simple sixteen taxon simulated data, and analysing simulated data. 

## Multi-species coalescent sixteen taxon
Use for generating data in a multispecies coalescent framework with 16 taxon species tree, and analysing simulated data.

## Multi-species coalescent sixteen taxon
Use for generating data in a multispecies coalescent framework with 4 taxon species tree, and analysing simulated data.

## Empirical Example
Scripts for empirical example presented in the study.
